# L10VisitorManagmentSystem

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/). Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ, `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

Update your local database connection in `application.properties` or create your own `application-local.properties` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For this, in IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing - [learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

The application can then be started with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/l10-visitor-managment-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
